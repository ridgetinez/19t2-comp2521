# Week 3: Recursion & BSTs

Problems & Understanding:
- **Flood Fill Algorithm | LeetCode Problem:** 
    [This problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) helps train your recursive
    thinking by solving a classic sweep and mark on a 2D array. Given a 2D bit-array
    where a 1 represents land and 0 represents water, count the number of islands, where
    a single island is a connected piece of land. Solve this and we'll give you a bonus mark
    for this/next lab.
- **Binary Tree Readings & (GREAT) Problems | Stanford:**
    This is a [set of problems and notes](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/110/BinaryTrees.html) all about manipulating and traversing binary search trees.
    Great practice for your midsemester examinations! Highly recommend going through at least
    three of these to boost your confidence coming into those exams.

Towards Mastery:
- **AVL Trees | MIT 6.006:**
    We can add conditions on the insert of values into our tree in order to maintain that all operations
    on the tree are O(log|n|). AVL Trees are one example of this. We'll be covering this next week,
    but it's good to get a dose of this content from Erik Demaine - I enjoy his lecture style.
